## ⚡ Installation

> [!NOTE]
> This fork manages its own configuration folder independently — it does **not** overwrite or modify any existing setup. However, it does require [illogical-impulse](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland) to be installed and running.

```bash
cd ~/.config/quickshell/
git clone https://github.com/rubberpirate/end4-enhanced
killall qs 2>/dev/null; qs -c end4-pC > /dev/null 2>&1 & disown
```

### 🔧 Set as your default shell (optional)

If you like it and want it to load by default instead of `ii`, edit:

```bash
~/.config/hypr/hyprland/variables.lua
```

And change this line:

```lua
hl.env("qsConfig", "ii")
```

to:

```lua
hl.env("qsConfig", "end4-pC")
```

> [!TIP]
> After saving, restart Hyprland or run `hyprctl reload` to apply the change.

### ⚙️ Settings keybind

To open the settings panel, add this to your Hyprland config:

```lua
hl.bind("SUPER + escape", hl.dsp.global("quickshell:settingsToggle"), {description = "Toggle settings"})
```

> **Note:** Settings is an overlay panel, not a regular window — `Super + Q` won't close it. Use the same keybind to toggle it or press `Escape`.

---

## ❓ FAQ

### How do I see my keybinds?

Open the launcher (`SUPER`) and type `<` — it'll show you the full list of configured keybinds.

### Why doesn't Settings have a search bar?

It doesn't need one — the launcher already does that job. Open the launcher (`SUPER`) and just type what you're looking for (e.g. `wallpaper`, `bar`, `blur`); it'll match against page names and section keywords and jump you straight to the right Settings page, so there's no need for a separate search inside Settings itself.
