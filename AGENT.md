# AGENT.md

Reference for coding agents (and humans) working in this repository. This file explains what the
project is, how it's put together, and where things live. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for how to work in
it day to day.

## What this is

`end4-pC` is a **Quickshell** shell configuration for **Hyprland** — a full desktop UI (bar, docks,
sidebars, on-screen displays, notifications, launchers, lock screen, etc.) written entirely in QML
and run by the [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org) runtime (`qs`), not a compiled application.

It's a personal fork of [illogical-impulse](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland) (by `end-4`),
itself forked by `pctrade` as `end4-pC`, and further forked here. The upstream chain is:

```
end-4/dots-hyprland  →  pctrade/end4-pC (upstream remote)  →  this fork (origin remote)
```

Check `git remote -v` before assuming which remote is "the real one" — `origin` is this fork,
`upstream` is `pctrade/end4-pC`.

This directory is **not a standalone app repo** — it's dropped into `~/.config/quickshell/end4-pC`
on a running Hyprland system and loaded by `qs -c end4-pC`. It depends on a companion Hyprland
config (also part of the illogical-impulse project, installed separately to `~/.config/hypr/`) for
keybinds, IPC event names, and layer-shell behavior assumptions.

## Runtime model — read this before assuming anything about "building" or "compiling"

There is no build step. Every `.qml` file is interpreted live by the `qs` process. When any `.qml`
file under this directory changes on disk, **the entire shell hot-reloads** (you'll see
`[To Do] File loaded` / `[Notifications] File loaded` lines in the log when this happens — those
two singletons happen to log on every full reload, which makes them a convenient reload marker even
though the message text doesn't literally describe what changed).

- Entry point: `shell.qml` → loads a **panel family** (currently only `"ii"`, from
  `panelFamilies/IllogicalImpulseFamily.qml`) which is a flat list of `PanelLoader { component: X {} }`
  entries, one per top-level feature module.
- Singletons (declared with `pragma Singleton`) are the shell's shared state and services. They are
  addressed by their QML type name directly (e.g. `Config`, `GlobalStates`, `Audio`) — no explicit
  import needed beyond the directory-level `import qs.services` / `import qs.modules.common`.
- QML singletons appear to **persist across most hot-reloads** rather than being torn down and
  recreated the same way scene components are — don't assume editing a singleton always produces
  an immediately-visible fresh instance; when in doubt, verify with a temporary `console.log` in an
  `onXChanged` handler (see CONTRIBUTING.md's verification workflow).

### Where to look when something goes wrong

The running `qs` process writes two logs per instance, found under
`/run/user/<uid>/quickshell/by-id/<hash>/`:

- `log.log` — human-readable, this is the one to `tail`/`grep`. Contains `DEBUG qml:` lines (your
  `console.log` output), `WARN scene:` (QML runtime errors/warnings with file:line), and other
  component warnings (D-Bus, desktop entries, etc.).
- `log.qslog` — a much larger structured/binary trace log. Rarely worth reading directly; `log.log`
  covers almost everything needed.

Find the current instance's log with:
```bash
ls -la /proc/$(pgrep -f 'qs -c end4-pC')/fd | grep log.log
```

**Known quirk:** `console.log` output to `log.log` can appear noticeably delayed (stdio buffering) —
a print can sit unflushed for several seconds before showing up, sometimes interleaved with later
events in a way that looks like a stale/wrong value at first glance. If a debug print looks wrong,
wait and re-check before concluding the code is broken.

## The Config system (settings page ↔ persisted JSON)

`Config.qml` defines the **entire** settings schema as nested `JsonObject` properties (e.g.
`Config.options.bar.resources.alwaysShowCpu`). This is not just an in-memory tree — Quickshell's
`JsonAdapter`/`JsonObject` machinery automatically:

1. Loads `~/.config/illogical-impulse/config.json` into `Config.options` on startup.
2. Persists any property write back to that file (debounced by `Config.readWriteDelay`, 50ms).

Consequences for making changes:

- Adding a new setting = add a `property <type> name: <default>` inside the right nested
  `JsonObject` in `Config.qml`. No migration code needed; missing keys just fall back to the QML
  default until the user's `config.json` gets the key written the first time it changes.
- The settings UI (`modules/ii/settings/pages/*.qml`) is hand-written QML, not generated from the
  schema — every setting needs a corresponding `ConfigSwitch`/`ConfigSpinBox`/`ConfigSelectionArray`/
  etc. row added manually in the relevant page, bound with `checked: Config.options.x.y` /
  `onCheckedChanged: Config.options.x.y = checked`.
- Consumers read `Config.options.x.y` directly and reactively - no separate "load config" step.
- **`Config.readWriteDelay`'s 50ms debounce only covers the disk write - it does nothing to stop
  every keystroke from firing whatever else reactively reads that option.** A `ConfigTextArea`
  bound as `onValueChanged: Config.options.x.y = value` re-triggers every consumer of
  `Config.options.x.y` (e.g. the media widget's player-matching, or a quote re-render) once per
  keystroke, not once per edit. Where the option feeds something more than a simple display value,
  add a local `Timer` (600ms is the convention already used, see `BarConfig.qml`'s
  `mediaDebounceTimer` and `BackgroundConfig.qml`'s `quoteDebounceTimer`) that assigns to
  `Config.options.x.y` only after typing pauses, instead of assigning directly in `onValueChanged`.

`GlobalStates.qml` is the sibling singleton for state that should **not** persist (is this sidebar
currently open, is the bar in autoHide-triggered-show state, etc.) - don't add ephemeral UI state to
`Config`, and don't add persisted settings to `GlobalStates`.

## Hyprland integration

Two separate mechanisms are in play, for different reasons:

1. **Quickshell's native `Quickshell.Hyprland` IPC bindings** (`Hyprland`, `HyprlandMonitor`,
   `HyprlandWorkspace`, `HyprlandToplevel`, `Hyprland.workspaces`, `Hyprland.monitorFor(screen)`,
   `Connections { target: Hyprland; function onRawEvent(event) {...} }`) - reactive, bindable,
   preferred when the data you need is exposed through it.
2. **`services/HyprlandData.qml`**, which shells out to `hyprctl clients/monitors/layers/workspaces
   -j` on a `Process` every time a (non-excluded) Hyprland IPC event fires. This exists because some
   state genuinely isn't exposed via (1) - e.g. whether a monitor's special workspace is currently
   *shown* (`monitor.specialWorkspace.name`), which only `hyprctl monitors -j` surfaces. Expect
   ~0.5-1s latency on this path (event → spawn `hyprctl` → parse JSON → property update) since it's
   process-based, not a live subscription.

**This user's Hyprland config uses a Lua-based config layer** (`hl.bind(...)`, `hl.dsp....(...)` in
`~/.config/hypr/hyprland/*.lua`). This changes how `hyprctl dispatch` needs to be invoked manually
(e.g. from a terminal while debugging) - plain vanilla syntax like
`hyprctl dispatch togglespecialworkspace special` fails with a Lua parse error on this system.
The working form mirrors the Lua binding calls directly, e.g.:
```bash
hyprctl dispatch 'hl.dsp.workspace.toggle_special("special")'
```
This is purely a manual-testing/CLI concern - IPC events, layer-shell behavior, and everything the
QML code touches are unaffected by this; only raw `hyprctl dispatch <dispatcher> <args>` calls typed
by a human/agent need the Lua-call form on this particular machine.

**`hyprctl hyprsunset temperature` (no argument) is not a reliable on/off query.** It always echoes
back the last explicitly-`temperature`-set numeric value - calling `hyprctl hyprsunset identity`
(the "off" dispatch) never resets it to any sentinel, so there is no way to distinguish "identity
mode, last set to N" from "on at N" through this query. `services/Hyprsunset.qml` used to compare
this query against a hardcoded `6500` to infer active state (also just factually wrong -
`hyprsunset --help` confirms the real default is `6000`) and got it wrong on essentially every
restart. Don't rely on querying `hyprsunset`'s live state at all; track on/off intent yourself
(see how `Hyprsunset.qml` now persists it via `Persistent.qml` instead).

**That same bare `--temperature 6000` default also bit the daemon's cold start, not just state
queries.** `Hyprsunset.qml` used to spawn `hyprsunset` with no flags (`pidof hyprsunset ||
hyprsunset`) and immediately fire a separate, fire-and-forget `hyprctl hyprsunset identity`/
`temperature` correction right after via `execDetached`. On a warm system that correction reaches
the already-running daemon fine, but on a cold start (nothing running yet) it races the daemon's
IPC socket coming up and can silently fail, leaving `hyprsunset` stuck at its own 6000K default
indefinitely - toggling night light off after a restart looked like it did nothing, and toggling it
on read as the tint "intensifying" (6000K → the configured, warmer temperature) rather than turning
on from neutral. Fixed by launching `hyprsunset` with the target state already as CLI flags
(`--temperature N` / `--identity`) instead of spawning bare and correcting after the fact - a
freshly-spawned daemon now starts in the right state with no window where it's wrong.

## Layer-shell (wlr-layer-shell) gotchas

Widgets that are `PanelWindow`s pick a `WlrLayershell.layer` (`Background < Bottom < Top < Overlay`).
Two non-obvious behaviors have bitten this codebase before and are worth knowing:

- Hyprland renders **fullscreen windows above the `Top` layer** (this is why a bar on `Top` disappears
  under a fullscreen app by default), but **below `Overlay`**. A special workspace opened on top of a
  fullscreen window compounds this. Fixing "X becomes unclickable/invisible under fullscreen +
  special workspace" generally means conditionally promoting that surface to `Overlay` only in that
  specific combination (see `modules/ii/bar/Bar.qml`'s `WlrLayershell.layer` binding and
  `modules/ii/screenCorners/ScreenCorners.qml`'s `fullscreen` property for the reference
  implementation).
- **Same-layer surfaces resolve overlap by stacking order, not layer priority.** If two `PanelWindow`s
  end up on the same layer and physically overlap, whichever the compositor considers "on top" wins
  *all* input in the overlapping region - the other surface's mask in that area is simply unreachable.
  When this happens, don't fight the ambiguous stacking order; instead carve the contested rectangle
  out of the losing surface's own `mask` using a `Region { intersection: Intersection.Subtract; ... }`
  child region, sized/positioned to exactly exclude the other surface's hit-zone. See `Bar.qml`'s
  `mask:` property for the pattern (it excludes `ScreenCorners.qml`'s corner-open hit rects when both
  are forced to `Overlay`).
- **Compositor blur behind a surface depends on that surface's actual alpha clearing a per-namespace
  threshold**, not just on "blur" being enabled somewhere. The companion Hyprland config
  (`~/.config/hypr/hyprland/rules.lua`) sets `hl.layer_rule({ match = { namespace = "quickshell:.*" },
  ignore_alpha = 0.79 })` (plus a `blur = true` rule) - pixels with alpha below that threshold are
  *not* blurred, they just show plain unblurred transparency. This is why picking the right
  `Appearance.colors.colLayer*` token matters for a floating popup, not just picking "a" transparent
  one - see the Design language section below.
- **The region selector intentionally takes exclusive focus.** Dismissable panels normally close
  when `GlobalFocusGrab` is cleared, but the selector first sets
  `GlobalStates.settingsHeldForRegionSelector` so Settings can remain visible in screenshots without
  racing surface creation. Because clearing the grab also empties its dismissable list, Settings
  must re-register itself when selection ends even though its own `visible` property never changed.

## Dynamic/data-driven QML gotchas

Relevant to anything that instantiates QML components from external data (JSON manifests, config
arrays, etc.) rather than static declarations - e.g. the plugin system in
`modules/common/plugins/`:

- **`item[propName] = value` (JS bracket assignment) only resolves real top-level property names.**
  It does not walk a dotted path into a grouped property - `item["anchors.centerIn"] = parent` or
  `item["font.pixelSize"] = 20` will not do what it looks like it should; the real properties are
  `item.anchors.centerIn` and `item.font.pixelSize`, which bracket-notation string keys don't
  resolve into. If a data-driven schema needs to set grouped properties, either give the renderer
  explicit dot-path-splitting logic, or keep the schema flat and avoid grouped-property keys
  entirely.
- **A component-type/binding-target whitelist and the renderer that's supposed to honor it are two
  separate lists that can drift apart.** `PluginValidator.js`'s `componentWhitelist` and
  `PluginNode.qml`'s renderer `switch` need to name exactly the same set of component types - a type
  present in one but not the other means either "validates fine but silently renders nothing" or (if
  the renderer's list is the wider one) an unvalidated type reaching the renderer. Treat this the
  same as the Config-schema/settings-page two-sidedness described above: a change to one side isn't
  done until the other side matches.
- Bundled plugins that need behavior the data-only node tree cannot express may use a narrowly
  scoped renderer type, as `bundled/atAGlance/AtAGlance.qml` does for date formatting, timed quote
  rotation, and quote-file loading. Add that type to both the validator and renderer, and keep
  arbitrary processes or script evaluation out of manifests.
- **`FileView` (`Quickshell.Io`) loads asynchronously - `.text()` right after calling `.reload()`
  is not guaranteed to return the new content.** The correct pattern (used throughout this codebase
  - `MaterialSymbolsSearch.qml`, `Notifications.qml`, `Emojis.qml`, `Profile.qml`) is to read
  `.text()` from inside the `onLoaded` handler, not immediately after `reload()`. A `PluginManager`
  rewrite that called `fileView.reload(); const text = fileView.text();` back-to-back silently got
  an empty string every time, with no error - only a `console.log` inside the failure branch (which
  never fired, since nothing *failed*, it just wasn't ready yet) would have revealed it.
- **`Repeater` only auto-binds a model item to a `required property` declared on the delegate's
  *root* object, not on a descendant.** `required property var modelData` on a widget nested a level
  or two inside the actual delegate root throws `Required property modelData was not initialized`
  for every instance. Put the `required property` on the outermost delegate item and forward it down
  as an ordinary (non-required) property if a nested child needs it.
- **`qs` is not a usable JS object from inside a `Qt.binding(function() {...})` closure.** It's a
  module-namespace prefix the QML engine resolves at compile time for declarative bindings, not a
  runtime global - `qs.modules.common.Appearance.colors[colorName]` inside an imperative closure
  throws `ReferenceError: qs is not defined`, silently leaving that binding's target property
  undefined (no crash, so it's easy to miss unless you actually watch the log with a plugin
  enabled). Import the singleton directly (`import qs.modules.common`) and reference it by its bare
  name (`Appearance.colors[colorName]`) instead. This one went unnoticed through two prior plugin
  merges (clock, battery) because `plugins.enabled` in the shared config was empty the whole time -
  the manifests were validated and rendered structurally, but never with `Appearance.colors.*`/
  `Appearance.rounding.*` bindings actually resolving against a real running instance.
- **Never `anchors.fill: parent` a `Loader` whose *own* size is meant to be derived from the loaded
  item's implicit size.** `Loader` forces the loaded item to match the Loader's size whenever the
  Loader itself has an explicit size (anchors count as explicit sizing) - but if the wrapping
  `Item`'s `implicitWidth`/`implicitHeight` are themselves bound to `loader.item.implicitWidth`,
  that's a direct cycle (item forced to match wrapper, wrapper's size derived from item) and Qt logs
  `Binding loop detected for property "implicitWidth"` and gives up re-evaluating it. Leave the
  Loader unanchored so it mirrors the item's natural size instead; set explicit width/height via the
  item's own properties (e.g. manifest `props`) when a fixed size is actually wanted.
- **Do not put dynamic object maps in a `JsonAdapter`, including through a `property var`.** Plugin
  ids and monitor names are not known when QML compiles, while `JsonObject` only supports declared
  properties. Writing undeclared children caused `JsonAdapter::deserializeRec` to segfault on the
  following config reload; declaring a `property var` map also segfaulted while loading it. Keep
  dynamic plugin layout in `PluginState.qml`, which parses and writes `plugin-state.json` with a raw
  `FileView`. Fixed-schema user settings still belong in `Config.qml`.
- Plugin manifests may declare a constrained top-level `options` array (`boolean`, `choice`, or
  `number`). `PluginOptions.qml` renders those controls and `PluginState.qml` persists their dynamic
  values. Desktop backdrop blur is also per-plugin state: a manifest opts into its default with
  `desktopWidget.blur: true`, while the generated **Blur background** option always lets the user
  override it. Do not make `PluginWidget` blur every plugin unconditionally.
- Desktop plugin delegates are retained for every available manifest and gated through an animated
  `FadeLoader`, rather than repeating only the enabled ids. Removing a model delegate destroys it
  immediately and makes an M3 exit transition impossible; keep disabled loaders dormant until their
  fade-and-scale exit reaches zero opacity.
- **A `Process`'s `onExited` handler that ignores its `exitCode` argument will happily act on stale
  data.** `TempScreenshotProcess` writes to a deterministic path (`image-${screen.name}`), so a failed
  `grim` run used to leave the *previous* successful capture sitting there untouched - the region
  selector/screen translator would silently proceed against stale image data with no error, since
  nothing actually "failed" from QML's perspective. Always check `exitCode` in `onExited` before
  trusting the process's output exists or is fresh; `rm -f`-ing the target path before launching the
  process (see `TempScreenshotProcess.qml`) turns a silent stale-reuse into an honest empty-file
  failure instead.
- **An overlay `Item` placed on top of an interactive control (e.g. a decorative `Flickable`-based
  mask drawn over a `TextField`/`TextArea`) will silently eat the clicks meant to focus that
  control**, unless the overlay is `enabled: false`. `ConfigTextArea`'s `password: true` mode draws
  `PasswordChars` (a `Flickable`) directly over the real field to render Material-shape dots in
  place of the native glyphs; without `enabled: false` on that overlay's `Loader`, clicking the
  field just fed the click to the Flickable instead, so the field never focused and typing appeared
  to do nothing. This only surfaces where focus is obtained by clicking - `LockSurface.qml`'s
  password box uses the identical overlay structure but never hit this, since it
  `forceActiveFocus()`s itself programmatically instead of depending on a click.
- **A QML property binding that calls a C++ invokable method (not a property read) will not
  re-evaluate when that method's underlying data changes.** `DesktopEntries.applications` takes a
  few seconds to populate after `qs` starts. `DragApps.qml`'s pinned-app launcher bound
  `deskEntry: appEntry ? DesktopEntries.heuristicLookup(appId) : null` once at delegate creation -
  since `heuristicLookup()` is a plain invokable, not a property, the binding engine can't see it
  depends on `applications`, so `deskEntry` came back `null` (evaluated before the scan finished)
  and then never updated. Any pinned app that wasn't already running at shell startup became
  permanently unlaunchable for that session - clicking it silently no-op'd via `deskEntry?.execute()`.
  `DockAppButton.qml` and `DocktoPanel.qml` had independently worked around this with their own
  `Connections { target: DesktopEntries; function onApplicationsChanged() { ... } }`, but
  `DragApps.qml` was missing the same fix - this was three copies of the same fragile pattern with
  one left unpatched. Consolidated into `modules/common/widgets/LiveDesktopEntry.qml`, a small
  non-visual `Item` that takes an `appId` and exposes a live-refreshing `entry`; all three call
  sites now use it (`deskEntry: liveDeskEntry.entry` instead of duplicating the `Connections`).
  Covered by `tests/tst_live_desktop_entry.qml` against a mock `DesktopEntries`
  (`tests/mocks/Quickshell/DesktopEntries.qml`) that can simulate `applications` populating late via
  `mockSetEntries()`. When a binding depends on the result of an invokable rather than a property,
  add an explicit `Connections` re-fetch on the relevant `*Changed` signal instead of trusting the
  binding to track it - and prefer extracting it into a reusable, testable component over
  re-inlining the same fix at each call site.

## Design language

The shell follows **Material 3 / Material 3 Expressive**. `Appearance.qml` is the single source of
design tokens - color roles (`Appearance.colors.col*`, `Appearance.m3colors.m3*`), font sizes
(`Appearance.font.pixelSize.*`), rounding (`Appearance.rounding.*`), animation curves/durations
(`Appearance.animation.*`). New UI should pull from these rather than hardcoding colors/sizes/
durations, both for dark/light theme correctness and for consistency with the rest of the shell.

**Strict UI Guidelines:** See [`docs/M3_GUIDELINES.md`](docs/M3_GUIDELINES.md) for the definitive rules on tokens, rounding, layering, and expressive motion that all new components must follow.

Shared building blocks to reach for before writing something from scratch: `StyledText`,
`StyledComboBox`/`StyledComboBoxSearch`, `StyledSlider`, `StyledToolTip`/`StyledToolTipContent`,
`RippleButton`, `MaterialSymbol`, `ResourceCard`, `GroupedList` + `ConfigSwitch`/`ConfigSpinBox`/
`ConfigSelectionArray`/`ConfigComboBox`/`ConfigTextArea` (settings rows), `StyledPopup`,
`StyledRectangularShadow`. All in `modules/common/widgets/`.

`ConfigTextArea` is the text-entry counterpart to `ConfigSwitch` (icon + label/description on the
left, a bordered `TextArea` field on the right) and is the standard single-line settings field -
prefer it over building a raw `TextField`/`TextArea` row by hand. Set `password: true` for masked
input - this draws the lockscreen's `PasswordChars` Material-shape dots over the field instead of
the native glyphs (`TextArea` has no `echoMode`, unlike `TextField`, so masking is done purely by
making the real glyphs transparent), and shows an optional reveal toggle (`revealButton`, defaults
to `password`). There used to be a separate pill-shaped `ConfigInput` for this; it was removed and
folded into `ConfigTextArea` once `ConfigTextArea` became the de facto standard across the settings
pages - don't reintroduce a second single-line text-entry widget.

`GroupedList` normally separates and subtly rounds each row. Set `cohesive: true` when several
controls form one continuous semantic unit (for example, the fields and actions for a single custom
AI provider). Cohesive mode removes internal spacing and corner rounding while retaining the outer
group corners. Controls rendered inside a group should rely on the group's inset; avoid adding a
second horizontal inset that misaligns their icons or labels with neighboring rows.

**`colLayer0` vs `colLayer1`/`colLayer2`/...** - these are not interchangeable "just pick one that
looks transparent enough" tokens:
- `colLayer0`'s alpha comes from `backgroundTransparency` (gated by
  `Config.options.appearance.transparency.enable`, ~0.89 opacity by default) - use it for the
  **outermost** background of a standalone floating surface (a popup/toast/OSD that sits directly on
  a `PanelWindow { color: "transparent" }` with nothing else behind it). See `MediaControls.qml` and
  `OsdTextIndicator.qml`.
- `colLayer1` and above derive from `contentTransparency` (~0.43 default, also gated by the same
  `enable` toggle) and are meant for **cards nested inside an already-opaque parent surface** (e.g.
  a list item inside the sidebar, which itself already provides a `colLayer0` backing). Used at the
  top level of a standalone popup, this token's alpha is low enough to visibly show
  through-but-unblurred transparency without ever clearing the `ignore_alpha` threshold above.
