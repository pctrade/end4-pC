# AGENT.md

Reference for coding agents (and humans) working in this repository. This file explains what the
project is, how it's put together, and where things live. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for how to work in
it day to day.

## What this is

`end4-pC` is a **Quickshell** shell configuration for **Hyprland** — a full desktop UI (bar, docks,
sidebars, on-screen displays, notifications, launchers, lock screen, etc.) written entirely in QML
and run by the [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org) runtime (`qs`), not a compiled application.

It's a personal fork of [illogical-impulse](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland) (by `end-4`),
itself forked by `pctrade` as `end4-pC`, and further forked here. The upstream chain is:

```
end-4/dots-hyprland  →  pctrade/end4-pC (upstream remote)  →  this fork (origin remote)
```

Check `git remote -v` before assuming which remote is "the real one" — `origin` is this fork,
`upstream` is `pctrade/end4-pC`.

This directory is **not a standalone app repo** — it's dropped into `~/.config/quickshell/end4-pC`
on a running Hyprland system and loaded by `qs -c end4-pC`. It depends on a companion Hyprland
config (also part of the illogical-impulse project, installed separately to `~/.config/hypr/`) for
keybinds, IPC event names, and layer-shell behavior assumptions.

## Runtime model — read this before assuming anything about "building" or "compiling"

There is no build step. Every `.qml` file is interpreted live by the `qs` process. When any `.qml`
file under this directory changes on disk, **the entire shell hot-reloads** (you'll see
`[To Do] File loaded` / `[Notifications] File loaded` lines in the log when this happens — those
two singletons happen to log on every full reload, which makes them a convenient reload marker even
though the message text doesn't literally describe what changed).

- Entry point: `shell.qml` → loads a **panel family** (currently only `"ii"`, from
  `panelFamilies/IllogicalImpulseFamily.qml`) which is a flat list of `PanelLoader { component: X {} }`
  entries, one per top-level feature module.
- Singletons (declared with `pragma Singleton`) are the shell's shared state and services. They are
  addressed by their QML type name directly (e.g. `Config`, `GlobalStates`, `Audio`) — no explicit
  import needed beyond the directory-level `import qs.services` / `import qs.modules.common`.
- QML singletons appear to **persist across most hot-reloads** rather than being torn down and
  recreated the same way scene components are — don't assume editing a singleton always produces
  an immediately-visible fresh instance; when in doubt, verify with a temporary `console.log` in an
  `onXChanged` handler (see CONTRIBUTING.md's verification workflow).

### Where to look when something goes wrong

The running `qs` process writes two logs per instance, found under
`/run/user/<uid>/quickshell/by-id/<hash>/`:

- `log.log` — human-readable, this is the one to `tail`/`grep`. Contains `DEBUG qml:` lines (your
  `console.log` output), `WARN scene:` (QML runtime errors/warnings with file:line), and other
  component warnings (D-Bus, desktop entries, etc.).
- `log.qslog` — a much larger structured/binary trace log. Rarely worth reading directly; `log.log`
  covers almost everything needed.

Find the current instance's log with:
```bash
ls -la /proc/$(pgrep -f 'qs -c end4-pC')/fd | grep log.log
```

**Known quirk:** `console.log` output to `log.log` can appear noticeably delayed (stdio buffering) —
a print can sit unflushed for several seconds before showing up, sometimes interleaved with later
events in a way that looks like a stale/wrong value at first glance. If a debug print looks wrong,
wait and re-check before concluding the code is broken.

                              since Quickshell's own Hyprland IPC bindings don't expose everything
                              (e.g. per-monitor special-workspace state)

## The Config system (settings page ↔ persisted JSON)

`Config.qml` defines the **entire** settings schema as nested `JsonObject` properties (e.g.
`Config.options.bar.resources.alwaysShowCpu`). This is not just an in-memory tree — Quickshell's
`JsonAdapter`/`JsonObject` machinery automatically:

1. Loads `~/.config/illogical-impulse/config.json` into `Config.options` on startup.
2. Persists any property write back to that file (debounced by `Config.readWriteDelay`, 50ms).

Consequences for making changes:

- Adding a new setting = add a `property <type> name: <default>` inside the right nested
  `JsonObject` in `Config.qml`. No migration code needed; missing keys just fall back to the QML
  default until the user's `config.json` gets the key written the first time it changes.
- The settings UI (`modules/ii/settings/pages/*.qml`) is hand-written QML, not generated from the
  schema — every setting needs a corresponding `ConfigSwitch`/`ConfigSpinBox`/`ConfigSelectionArray`/
  etc. row added manually in the relevant page, bound with `checked: Config.options.x.y` /
  `onCheckedChanged: Config.options.x.y = checked`.
- Consumers read `Config.options.x.y` directly and reactively - no separate "load config" step.

`GlobalStates.qml` is the sibling singleton for state that should **not** persist (is this sidebar
currently open, is the bar in autoHide-triggered-show state, etc.) - don't add ephemeral UI state to
`Config`, and don't add persisted settings to `GlobalStates`.

## Hyprland integration

Two separate mechanisms are in play, for different reasons:

1. **Quickshell's native `Quickshell.Hyprland` IPC bindings** (`Hyprland`, `HyprlandMonitor`,
   `HyprlandWorkspace`, `HyprlandToplevel`, `Hyprland.workspaces`, `Hyprland.monitorFor(screen)`,
   `Connections { target: Hyprland; function onRawEvent(event) {...} }`) - reactive, bindable,
   preferred when the data you need is exposed through it.
2. **`services/HyprlandData.qml`**, which shells out to `hyprctl clients/monitors/layers/workspaces
   -j` on a `Process` every time a (non-excluded) Hyprland IPC event fires. This exists because some
   state genuinely isn't exposed via (1) - e.g. whether a monitor's special workspace is currently
   *shown* (`monitor.specialWorkspace.name`), which only `hyprctl monitors -j` surfaces. Expect
   ~0.5-1s latency on this path (event → spawn `hyprctl` → parse JSON → property update) since it's
   process-based, not a live subscription.

**This user's Hyprland config uses a Lua-based config layer** (`hl.bind(...)`, `hl.dsp....(...)` in
`~/.config/hypr/hyprland/*.lua`). This changes how `hyprctl dispatch` needs to be invoked manually
(e.g. from a terminal while debugging) - plain vanilla syntax like
`hyprctl dispatch togglespecialworkspace special` fails with a Lua parse error on this system.
The working form mirrors the Lua binding calls directly, e.g.:
```bash
hyprctl dispatch 'hl.dsp.workspace.toggle_special("special")'
```
This is purely a manual-testing/CLI concern - IPC events, layer-shell behavior, and everything the
QML code touches are unaffected by this; only raw `hyprctl dispatch <dispatcher> <args>` calls typed
by a human/agent need the Lua-call form on this particular machine.

**`hyprctl hyprsunset temperature` (no argument) is not a reliable on/off query.** It always echoes
back the last explicitly-`temperature`-set numeric value - calling `hyprctl hyprsunset identity`
(the "off" dispatch) never resets it to any sentinel, so there is no way to distinguish "identity
mode, last set to N" from "on at N" through this query. `services/Hyprsunset.qml` used to compare
this query against a hardcoded `6500` to infer active state (also just factually wrong -
`hyprsunset --help` confirms the real default is `6000`) and got it wrong on essentially every
restart. Don't rely on querying `hyprsunset`'s live state at all; track on/off intent yourself
(see how `Hyprsunset.qml` now persists it via `Persistent.qml` instead).

## Layer-shell (wlr-layer-shell) gotchas

Widgets that are `PanelWindow`s pick a `WlrLayershell.layer` (`Background < Bottom < Top < Overlay`).
Two non-obvious behaviors have bitten this codebase before and are worth knowing:

- Hyprland renders **fullscreen windows above the `Top` layer** (this is why a bar on `Top` disappears
  under a fullscreen app by default), but **below `Overlay`**. A special workspace opened on top of a
  fullscreen window compounds this. Fixing "X becomes unclickable/invisible under fullscreen +
  special workspace" generally means conditionally promoting that surface to `Overlay` only in that
  specific combination (see `modules/ii/bar/Bar.qml`'s `WlrLayershell.layer` binding and
  `modules/ii/screenCorners/ScreenCorners.qml`'s `fullscreen` property for the reference
  implementation).
- **Same-layer surfaces resolve overlap by stacking order, not layer priority.** If two `PanelWindow`s
  end up on the same layer and physically overlap, whichever the compositor considers "on top" wins
  *all* input in the overlapping region - the other surface's mask in that area is simply unreachable.
  When this happens, don't fight the ambiguous stacking order; instead carve the contested rectangle
  out of the losing surface's own `mask` using a `Region { intersection: Intersection.Subtract; ... }`
  child region, sized/positioned to exactly exclude the other surface's hit-zone. See `Bar.qml`'s
  `mask:` property for the pattern (it excludes `ScreenCorners.qml`'s corner-open hit rects when both
  are forced to `Overlay`).
- **Compositor blur behind a surface depends on that surface's actual alpha clearing a per-namespace
  threshold**, not just on "blur" being enabled somewhere. The companion Hyprland config
  (`~/.config/hypr/hyprland/rules.lua`) sets `hl.layer_rule({ match = { namespace = "quickshell:.*" },
  ignore_alpha = 0.79 })` (plus a `blur = true` rule) - pixels with alpha below that threshold are
  *not* blurred, they just show plain unblurred transparency. This is why picking the right
  `Appearance.colors.colLayer*` token matters for a floating popup, not just picking "a" transparent
  one - see the Design language section below.

## Dynamic/data-driven QML gotchas

Relevant to anything that instantiates QML components from external data (JSON manifests, config
arrays, etc.) rather than static declarations - e.g. the plugin system in
`modules/common/plugins/`:

- **`item[propName] = value` (JS bracket assignment) only resolves real top-level property names.**
  It does not walk a dotted path into a grouped property - `item["anchors.centerIn"] = parent` or
  `item["font.pixelSize"] = 20` will not do what it looks like it should; the real properties are
  `item.anchors.centerIn` and `item.font.pixelSize`, which bracket-notation string keys don't
  resolve into. If a data-driven schema needs to set grouped properties, either give the renderer
  explicit dot-path-splitting logic, or keep the schema flat and avoid grouped-property keys
  entirely.
- **A component-type/binding-target whitelist and the renderer that's supposed to honor it are two
  separate lists that can drift apart.** `PluginValidator.js`'s `componentWhitelist` and
  `PluginNode.qml`'s renderer `switch` need to name exactly the same set of component types - a type
  present in one but not the other means either "validates fine but silently renders nothing" or (if
  the renderer's list is the wider one) an unvalidated type reaching the renderer. Treat this the
  same as the Config-schema/settings-page two-sidedness described above: a change to one side isn't
  done until the other side matches.
- **`FileView` (`Quickshell.Io`) loads asynchronously - `.text()` right after calling `.reload()`
  is not guaranteed to return the new content.** The correct pattern (used throughout this codebase
  - `MaterialSymbolsSearch.qml`, `Notifications.qml`, `Emojis.qml`, `Profile.qml`) is to read
  `.text()` from inside the `onLoaded` handler, not immediately after `reload()`. A `PluginManager`
  rewrite that called `fileView.reload(); const text = fileView.text();` back-to-back silently got
  an empty string every time, with no error - only a `console.log` inside the failure branch (which
  never fired, since nothing *failed*, it just wasn't ready yet) would have revealed it.
- **`Repeater` only auto-binds a model item to a `required property` declared on the delegate's
  *root* object, not on a descendant.** `required property var modelData` on a widget nested a level
  or two inside the actual delegate root throws `Required property modelData was not initialized`
  for every instance. Put the `required property` on the outermost delegate item and forward it down
  as an ordinary (non-required) property if a nested child needs it.
- **`qs` is not a usable JS object from inside a `Qt.binding(function() {...})` closure.** It's a
  module-namespace prefix the QML engine resolves at compile time for declarative bindings, not a
  runtime global - `qs.modules.common.Appearance.colors[colorName]` inside an imperative closure
  throws `ReferenceError: qs is not defined`, silently leaving that binding's target property
  undefined (no crash, so it's easy to miss unless you actually watch the log with a plugin
  enabled). Import the singleton directly (`import qs.modules.common`) and reference it by its bare
  name (`Appearance.colors[colorName]`) instead. This one went unnoticed through two prior plugin
  merges (clock, battery) because `plugins.enabled` in the shared config was empty the whole time -
  the manifests were validated and rendered structurally, but never with `Appearance.colors.*`/
  `Appearance.rounding.*` bindings actually resolving against a real running instance.
- **Never `anchors.fill: parent` a `Loader` whose *own* size is meant to be derived from the loaded
  item's implicit size.** `Loader` forces the loaded item to match the Loader's size whenever the
  Loader itself has an explicit size (anchors count as explicit sizing) - but if the wrapping
  `Item`'s `implicitWidth`/`implicitHeight` are themselves bound to `loader.item.implicitWidth`,
  that's a direct cycle (item forced to match wrapper, wrapper's size derived from item) and Qt logs
  `Binding loop detected for property "implicitWidth"` and gives up re-evaluating it. Leave the
  Loader unanchored so it mirrors the item's natural size instead; set explicit width/height via the
  item's own properties (e.g. manifest `props`) when a fixed size is actually wanted.

## Design language

The shell follows **Material 3 / Material 3 Expressive**. `Appearance.qml` is the single source of
design tokens - color roles (`Appearance.colors.col*`, `Appearance.m3colors.m3*`), font sizes
(`Appearance.font.pixelSize.*`), rounding (`Appearance.rounding.*`), animation curves/durations
(`Appearance.animation.*`). New UI should pull from these rather than hardcoding colors/sizes/
durations, both for dark/light theme correctness and for consistency with the rest of the shell.

**Strict UI Guidelines:** See [`docs/M3_GUIDELINES.md`](docs/M3_GUIDELINES.md) for the definitive rules on tokens, rounding, layering, and expressive motion that all new components must follow.

Shared building blocks to reach for before writing something from scratch: `StyledText`,
`StyledComboBox`, `StyledSlider`, `StyledToolTip`/`StyledToolTipContent`, `RippleButton`,
`MaterialSymbol`, `ResourceCard`, `GroupedList` + `ConfigSwitch`/`ConfigSpinBox`/
`ConfigSelectionArray` (settings rows), `StyledPopup`, `StyledRectangularShadow`. All in
`modules/common/widgets/`.

**`colLayer0` vs `colLayer1`/`colLayer2`/...** - these are not interchangeable "just pick one that
looks transparent enough" tokens:
- `colLayer0`'s alpha comes from `backgroundTransparency` (gated by
  `Config.options.appearance.transparency.enable`, ~0.89 opacity by default) - use it for the
  **outermost** background of a standalone floating surface (a popup/toast/OSD that sits directly on
  a `PanelWindow { color: "transparent" }` with nothing else behind it). See `MediaControls.qml` and
  `OsdTextIndicator.qml`.
- `colLayer1` and above derive from `contentTransparency` (~0.43 default, also gated by the same
  `enable` toggle) and are meant for **cards nested inside an already-opaque parent surface** (e.g.
  a list item inside the sidebar, which itself already provides a `colLayer0` backing). Used at the
  top level of a standalone popup, this token's alpha is low enough to visibly show
  through-but-unblurred transparency without ever clearing the `ignore_alpha` threshold above.
